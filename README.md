## Git a Web Developer Workflow course project

This [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/) course taught me many essential web development tools and concepts, such as Gulp, Webpack, Babel, CSS preprocessor Post-CSS and CSS naming convention BEM, as well as the importance of responsive images and other important concepts.

I completed the instructional videos and coded the website myself, implementing what I learned.
